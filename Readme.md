IP Address Change Notifier
===========

Notifies you when your public IP address changes.

Log File
---------------------------------------

A log file is created with the date the IP address was changed along with the new IP address.

I have this running once on startup.<br/>
May consider changing this to run as a service or as part of a GUI.
